To collect data, you've mounted a camera to the hood (meaning the front) of the car, which takes pictures of the road ahead every few seconds as you drive around. \n",

The video lectures used the latter representation;  in this notebook, you'll use both representations, depending on which is more convenient for a particular step.  \n",
