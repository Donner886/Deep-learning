    "- However, using a deeper network does not help. A huge barrier to training them is vanishing  gradients; very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent prohibitively slow. \n",
    "- More specifically, during gradient descent, as you backpropagate from the final layer back to the first layer, you are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero. (or, in rare cases, grow exponentially quickly and 'explode' from gaining very large values)\n",
