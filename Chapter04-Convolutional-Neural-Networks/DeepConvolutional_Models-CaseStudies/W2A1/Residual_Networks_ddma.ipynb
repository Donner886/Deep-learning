    "- More specifically, during gradient descent, as you backpropagate from the final layer back to the first layer, you are multiplying by the weight matrix on each step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero. (or, in rare cases, grow exponentially quickly and 'explode' from gaining very large values)\n",
